        <i>TunnelBear is the easy-to-use VPN that keeps your internet connection private from your internet service provider, whoever runs that sketchy cafe with the free Wi-Fi or advertisers who want to profit off of your browsing data. Enabling TunnelBear is simple: it&apos;s available for PC, Mac, iOS, Android - there&apos;s even a Chrome extension; you just press the button and \*boom\* - your connection gets encrypted and you appear to the online services you&apos;re using as though you are some random in some random place - it&apos;s almost like you&apos;re wearing a mask. So start a 7-day free trial over at `tunnelbear.com/ltt` and keep your browsing private.</i>
