# Languages
I can't believe it's not \[Insert existing library here\]!

## Adding a language
Make a new file [named based on this](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) and import it in `index.js`  
Make an object full of functions

If your language requires context, take in some of the keys of the `extras` object that is passed in.

Some keys that you might find are:
